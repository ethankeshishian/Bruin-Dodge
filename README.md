## How to run the code

To run the code, follow the following steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub using the `git clone` command, or unzip the zip file.
2. Run the `index.html` file. You should see a localhost window open up in your default browser.
3. The game will begin automatically!

## What to expect

As soon as the game loads, you should be presented with a scene including a moving ball, which is the main character, a floor, and human-shaped obstacles spawning in front of you as the ball travels in the z direction.

You can control the main character by using the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard. The camera angle will change as you move. You can also pause the game by pressing the p key.

Your objective is to avoid the peopleâ€”if you hit a person, the game will end, where you can choose to play again.

Stay alive for as long as possible! Good luck!
